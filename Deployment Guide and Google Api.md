## Deployment
When deploying make sure you nano into your build.gradle file and make sure the file that is shown is the same as the one in build.sh
What happens when this isn't the same is, when you try to build it through terminal it wil break because it is telling the wrong server 
file to build something that isn't in it.

To deploy your project check out: https://github.com/UMM-CSci-3601/droplet-setup-and-build which I got from our Canvas site
This will run you through how to use droplet and all of the terminal commands needed to deploy.

## Gmail API
The Gmail API is much similar to Oauth in the sense that when you enter an email address it gets a token which is then passed to the google server that verifies its a legit email address and then that talks to our server. The API website is found https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/java (Google Developers). This will take you through a step by step process on setting up the gmail api.
